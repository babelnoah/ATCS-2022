        <h2 class="light-font">&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;I was born and grew up in San Francisco. Born the middle child in a family of three, I quickly learned what it meant to be competitive, and learned how to apply this skill into other areas of my life. <br><br>&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Being enrolled in a Chinese Emersion School since Kindergarden, my life has always been a balance of athletics and academics. I've learned to strive for my best whether that be on the court or in the classroom.</h2>
